<p style="font-family:'Courier New">Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, an initiative by our Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an attempt towards a cleaner India. It was launched on Oct 2nd, 2014 to celebrate the 145th birth anniversary of our Father of Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, and his ideologies about cleanliness. It is a nationwide cleanliness drive run under the Ministry of Drinking and Sanitation (rural areas) and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (urban areas). The campaign was sighted for five years and believed in accomplishing the proposed plans by Oct 2nd, 2019 which marks the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">The main objective of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is to aware the citizens of the country of their utmost priority and responsibility towards cleanliness in the nearby surroundings and the spread of filth and infectious parasites. The campaign primarily focuses on eradicating the unhealthy practices of open defecation and provide basic sanitation facilities by constructing toilets, solid-liquid waste disposal systems, supplying clean drinking water, etc. It aims at covering around 4041 statutory towns and cities across the country for cleaner streets, roads, towns, and infrastructure.</p>
<h1>STEREOTYPE</h1>
<p style="color:red;">Stereotype is an extreme generalisation of belief about a particular group o community of people. It is not only a preconceived notion about the certain group but a degree of expectation from the individuals of that group. These expectations are not only centred around a particular belief but also their attitude and personality.</p>

<p style="color:red;">Stereotypes are often inaccurate and create misconceptions regarding the community. Though stereotypes are sometimes useful while understanding groups of people, their culture and heritage, they are often over-generalised. These over-generalised stereotypes harm the individuals who belong to the group yet don’t completely identical to the preconceived notions.
<h1>DISCRIMINATION</h1>
<p style="color:red;">Our world has always been parted into two groups: victims of discrimination and those who discriminate against the former. The definition of discrimination denies opportunity or equal rights to a specific group of people that may be differentiated based on their religion, skin colour, or gender.</p>

<p style="color:red;">However, discrimination could be confused with prejudice and stereotype. Stereotypes are mental images we have on a particular group of people because of their religion, culture, or gender. Prejudice stems from stereotypes. It’s the act of judging by popular stereotypes.</p>
<h1>RIGHT TO EDUCATION</h1>
<p style="color:red;">The Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2002 inserted Article 21-A in the Constitution of India to provide free and compulsory education of all children in the age group of six to fourteen years as a Fundamental Right in such a manner as the State may, by law, determine. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, which represents the consequential legislation envisaged under Article 21-A, means that every child has a right to full time elementary education of satisfactory and equitable quality in a formal school which satisfies certain essential norms and standards.</p>

<p style="color:red;">April 2010. The title of the RTE Act incorporates the words ‘free and compulsory’. ‘Free education’ means that no child, other than a child who has been admitted by his or her parents to a school which is not supported by the appropriate Government, shall be liable to pay any kind of fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing elementary education. ‘Compulsory education’ casts an obligation on the appropriate Government and local authorities to provide and ensure admission, attendance and completion of elementary education by all children in the 6-14 age group. With this, India has moved forward to a rights based framework that casts a legal obligation on the Central and State Governments to implement this fundamental child right as enshrined in the Article 21A of the Constitution, in accordance with the provisions of the RTE Act.</p>

<h1>RIGHT TO FREEDOM</h1>
<p style="color:red;">The right to freedom is one of the most fundamental rights assured by the Indian constitution. It is because of the prevalence of these freedoms that make democracy is purposeful. Right to freedom generates liberty of expression and speech, association, or assembly or cooperatives, movement, right to practice any occupation or profession, right to liberty and life, protection and offences against detention and arrest in many cases. Per the Indian constitution’s 44th amendment, the right to hold and dispose of the property has been removed from the list of fundamental freedoms in the year 1978.</p>
